1. Creating Decorator for Time Consumed
2. Use of 'for.........else', to break out of loop
3. Breaking outerloop, for a case in Inner loop
4. use isinstance instead of type()
5. using list instead of set for appending and iteration saves good time.
6. for comparison use 'is' instead of '==' and is not istead of '!='
7. list comprehention speeds up list creation
8. use xrange instead of range
9. make all in functions, rather than just code interpreted eg:main()
10. oldstyle classes will cause some operations costier
11. Use __slots__ for mutex, it saves time and space in classes
12. use map instead of for loop to execute functions on many values
